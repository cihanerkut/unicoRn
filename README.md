## Import, analyze and visualize chromatography data from UNICORN software

This package will contain functions to import, analyze and visualize data generated during chromatography experiments using the UNICORN software.

UNICORN is the control software used in GE Healthcare HPLC systems. Although it has extended capabilities to perform various analyses on chromatograms, it has limited visualization options and it works only on Windows.

Data exported from the UNICORN software can be imported using this package, analyzed and visualized via ggplot2 to create publication-quality figures.
